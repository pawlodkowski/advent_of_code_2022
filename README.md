# Advent of Code 2022 using PostGreSQL

Cleaner documentation WIP. 

Most likely not going to have much time to commit to the competition this year, but I figured it'd be a nice way to sharpen my PostGreSQL skills. 

### Usage

For now, requires local installation of PostGres:

1. Start local PostGres server
2. Log in to local server, with any database of choice, e.g.:

```bash
psql -h localhost
```

3. Run from within psql shell, e.g.:

```sql
\i day01/solution.sql
```
