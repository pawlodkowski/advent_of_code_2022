# Advent of Code 2022 using PostGreSQL

Context: https://adventofcode.com/2022/about

Most likely not going to have much time to commit to the competition this year, but I figured it'd be a nice way to sharpen my PostGreSQL skills. 

Update: Got too busy with other things and fell behind in the daily competition. The current state of the repo is my limit for this year, and hopefully I'll
get farther next year (probably with PostGres again!).

### Usage

For now, requires local installation of PostGres:

1. Start local PostGres server
2. Log in to local server, with any database of choice, e.g.:

```bash
psql -h localhost
```

3. Run from within psql shell, e.g.:

```sql
\i day01/solution.sql
```
